Please see a detailed breakdown of the testing carried out for this application in [TESTING.md]().

# Finished Product

# Deployment

This website was developed using [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/solutions/collaborate), then committed and pushed to GitHub using the Codeanywhere terminal.

## Heroku Deployment

The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file using the terminal command:

   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a `Procfile` with the terminal command:

   ```bash
   echo web: python app.py > Procfile
   ```

3. `git add` and `git commit` the new requirements and Procfile and then `git push` the project to GitHub.
4. Create a new app on the [Herkou website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard. Give it a name and assign the region to Europe.
5. From the Heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment Method" and select GitHub.
6. Confirm the linking of the Heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.
7. In the Heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".
8. Set the following config vars:

    | KEY | VALUE |
    | :-- | :-- |
    | IP | 0.0.0.0 |
    | PORT | 5000 |
    | SECRET_KEY | ANY_SECRET_KEY* |
    | MONGO_URI | `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster_name>.hrljbrx.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority` |
    | DEBUG | TRUE** |

    - *Denotes a value that is specific to your app.

    - **This is set to true to enable us to see any bugs on the live site. __Please change to FALSE after deployment.__

    - To get your MONGO_URI read the MongoDB Atlas documentation [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/).

9. In the Heroku dashboard, click "Deploy".
10. In the "Manual Deployment" section of this page, make sure the "Master Branch" is selected and then click "Deploy Branch".

# My CookBook

![My CookBook Final Design](static/images/my-cookbook-mockup-final.png)

My CookBook is an interactive recipe web application, designed for users wanting to create, search for, edit and delete recipes.

The main goal for this application is to offer a fun and personalised experience for the user, giving them the ability to contribute their own recipe ideas to the online cooking community, whilst also allowing them to save ideas for their own use.

## Colour Scheme

![My CookBook Colour Scheme](static/images/mycookbook_colour_scheme.png)

The primary colours used for this application are as follows:

- Dark Red (#8B0000) - for the navbar, collapsible headers, and the large 'Sign In' and 'Register' buttons.
- Snow (#F9F4F5) - for the background to each page.
- Gray (#757575) - for all small buttons*.

*Other secondary colours are used for specific action buttons:

- Red (#F44336) - for the 'Delete' button.
- Light Blue (#42A5F5) - for the 'Edit' button.
- Green (#4CAF50) - for the 'Save' button.
- Orange (#FF9800) - for the 'Forget' button.

## Typography

The font-families used for this application are 'Nunito Sans' for the headers and 'Roboto' for the main body of text, with sans-serif as a fallback for both.
The inspiration for this font pairing came from [this website](https://www.fontpair.co/all).

## Wireframes

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) was used to develop the initial concept of the main page of the application - the 'Recipes' page. The developer wanted to keep the main layout of this page a common theme across other pages of the application. However, the ideas for other pageds were conceived as the project grew.

# Database Schema

The database used for this application is stored in the non-relational database __MongoDB__, which is known for using a "schema-less" or "schema-flexible" modeling concept. The reason behind the choice to use a non-relational database for this application was that the relation between each data-model wasn't as complex as - and didn't need to be manipulated like - a relational database data-model.

Please see below for examples of each data-model.

## Users

### Model

- `_id`: ObjectId (Automatically generated unique identifier)
- `username`: String (User's chosen username)
- `password`: String (User's password - this is hashed, using Werkzeug's Security Helper 'generate_password_hash')
- `my_cookbook`: Array (User's saved recipes - this array is empty upon user-creation)
  - `0`: String (ObjectID of recipe)
  - `1`: String (ObjectID of recipe)
  - `2`: String (ObjectID of recipe)

### Example

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("659153d1b9ce951d2bdf6597"),
  "username": "exampleuser123",
  "password": "scrypt:32768:8:1$ZbOMTxq9TMnRiLev$3...",
  "my_cookbook": {
    0: "6591544fb9ce951d2bdf6598",
    1: "6591545bdd6d1822d9e9d4c3",
    2: "65915467dd6d1822d9e9d4c4"
  }
}
```

## Meal Types

This schema is used primarily for users to categorise the recipes they add to the database. It is also a way for users to search for different meal types using the Search bar on the Recipes page.

### Model

- `_id`: ObjectId (Automatically generated unique identifier)
- `meal_type`: String (type of meal, i.e. breakfast)

### Example

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("659153d1b9ce951d2bdf6597"),
  "meal_type": "breakfast"
}
```

## Recipes

This is the main schema in which information about recipes is stored. Each key in the scheme is manipulated in different ways, such as adding the recipe's ID to the user's `my_cookbook` array.

### Model

- `_id`: ObjectId (Automatically generated unique identifier)
- `recipe_name`: String (Recipe Name)
- `recipe_desc`: String (Recipe Description)
- `meal_type`: String (Meal Type)
- `serves`: String (Serving Size)
- `ready_in`: Object (Time to prepare & cook)
  - `hours`: String
  - `minutes`: String
- `ingredients`: Array (Individual ingredients)
  - `0`: String (First ingredient)
  - `1`: String (Second ingredient)
  - `2`: String (Third ingredient)
- `method`: Array (Individual method steps)
  - `0`: String (Step 1)
  - `1`: String (Step 2)
  - `2`: String (Step 3)
- `created_by`: String (User who created the recipe)
- `recipe_img`: Object ('src' and 'alt' of the image provided)
  - `src`: String
  - `alt`: String

### Exmaple

```json
{
  "_id": ObjectId("6591596add6d1822d9e9d4c5"),
  "recipe_name": "Crustless Quiche Lorraine",
  "recipe_desc": "This simplified version of the classic French tart...",

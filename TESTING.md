## Code Validation

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) services were used to check for any code errors or misuse of syntax/elements in the HTML & CSS.

The [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) service was used to check for any code errors or misuse of syntax in the JavaScript.

The [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) service was used to check for any linting errors in the Python code.

### HTML

The W3C Markup Validator returned multiple errors and warnings with a lot of the Jinja templating language used. The developer chose to ignore these specific warnings, as this tool is primarily designed to validate static HTML and doesn't recognize server-side templating languages, including Jinja.

Other than the above, there were a few legitimate errors/warnings with the HTML on the following pages:

#### base.html

![base.html](static/images/html-validation-base-page.png)

- This section element contained the flashed messages provided using Jinja templating language. This warning was ignored as the flashed messages performed without issue.

#### add_recipe.html & edit_recipe.html

![add_recipe.html & edit_recipe.html](static/images/html-validation-add-edit-recipe.png)

- These errors showed up for both pages. The code targeted is being used in placeholder text for a text area - the `&#10` makes each piece of text appear on a new line. These errors were ignored as the code performed without issue.

### CSS

The W3C CSS Validator returned no errors in the code.

### JavaScript

The JSHint Validation returned a few errors in the code for undefined variables:

- `$` - This was ignored as it is required for functions using jQuery.
- `M` - This was ignored as it is used for initialisation whilst using Materialize.

## Lighthouse Report

Lighthouse in Google Chrome Dev Tools was used to test performance, accessibility, best practices and search engine optimisation of the webpage.

Suggestions were made to optimise SEO by adding 'meta' tags to each page. However, this was ignored as meta tags were included in the base template and were being duplicated via Jinja.
